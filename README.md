**GitHub Actions daily run order (weekdays 20:00 UTC):**
1. `ingest_weather.py` — fetch weather at 20 ports + 8 straits, upload to BigQuery
2. `update_combined.py` — upload bdi_daily + rebuild all 10 analytical tables

## Setup (Step by Step)

### Step 1 — Get your API keys

**OpenWeatherMap (Port weather + straits):**
1. Go to https://openweathermap.org/api
2. Register → Account → API Keys → copy (takes ~10 min to activate)

**AISStream (Vessel tracking — optional, for notebook 04 only):**
1. Go to https://aisstream.io
2. Register → API Keys → copy

### Step 2 — Run notebooks in order (Google Colab)
```
01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06
```
This populates `data/clean/` with the static source CSVs and uploads the base tables to BigQuery.

### Step 3 — Update BDI when needed (monthly or as needed)
BDI data is maintained exactly like Comtrade — manually via notebook:
1. Go to: https://www.investing.com/indices/baltic-dry-historical-data
2. Click **Download Data** (top-right of the chart)
3. Save the file to `data/raw/`
4. Re-run notebook `02_ingest_clean_bdi_investing.ipynb` in Colab
5. Commit and push the updated `data/clean/bdi_clean.csv`

GitHub Actions will automatically upload it to BigQuery on the next daily run.

### Step 4 — Set GitHub Secrets
Go to: **GitHub repo → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

| Secret name | Value |
|-------------|-------|
| `WEATHER_API_KEY` | Your OpenWeatherMap key |
| `GCP_KEY` | Full contents of your GCP service account JSON file |
| `BQ_PROJECT` | Your GCP project ID (e.g. `msba305-shipping-123`) |
| `BQ_DATASET` | `shipping_data` |

### Step 5 — Enable GitHub Actions
The workflow triggers automatically weekdays at 20:00 UTC.
You can also trigger manually: **Actions tab → Daily Maritime Data Update → Run workflow**
